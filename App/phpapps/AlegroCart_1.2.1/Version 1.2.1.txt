Alegro Cart version 1.2 (Released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE)

This version modifies the catalog template structure.
	The template now includes the content folder for main controller .tpl files, the module folder for module .tpl files, and
the shared fored for shared .tpl files.
	New is the styles folder. This folder contains the css folder and the image folder the were previously in the template folder.
	
	The template and styles folders have separate settings in admin allowing you to chose a specific template and a different style.
	
MODEL
The complete catalog has been converted to a true MVC design. You will find models located in folders in the catalog/model folder.
All controllers in the catalog/controller and catalog/extension/module have been converted to use model database access.

New Security Features

The admin login now has serialized input form that only allows login from that form to prevent CSFR and brute force attacks.
If a request is made that does now validate from the on site form, a validation error occurs. Login requests are limited to 
5 attempts before being redirected from login page.

Sensitive data is protected by serizlizing input forms to ensure the form is submited from the local site. This is enabled for all user 
data in admin and catalog.

There are many display modifications in the catalog system, most notably in the customer account files and product reviews.

Version 1.2.1

The styles folder Now includes a new folder, colors. This folder contains a color.css file for each color
style available.
In the image folder there are coresponding color folders that contain images to reflect the color chosen.
In admin/setting you now have a choice of which template, style and color.
This reduces the amount of duplicated code and makes things like color change available with one setting.
CSS is cleaned up to allow easier changes and modifications by the developer.

SEO is completed to now include the review pages.
