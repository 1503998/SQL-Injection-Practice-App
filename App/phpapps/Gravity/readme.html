<p align="left">The Gravity Board X 
project is an open source message board system trying to be like no others.&nbsp; 
Gravity Board X features a unique front page layout, and pushes the envelope 
with technologies not often found in free message boards such as a CSS-based 
layout, graphical WYSIWYG message editor and AJAX framework.&nbsp; Please enjoy 
the result of the free time used to create this project, and spread the word if 
you enjoy it!</p>

<p align="left"><b><u><font size="5">1. Installation</font></u></b></p>
<p align="left"><u><b>Requirements/General Information</b></u></p>
<p align="left">In order to be compatible with the GBX AJAX framework,
<font face="Times New Roman">browsers must support JavaScript and the 
XMLHttpRequest Object.&nbsp; Popular browsers supporting this </font>inc<font face="Times New Roman">lude: 
<b>Mozilla Firefox 1.0, Internet Explorer 5.0, Opera 7.6, Netscape 7.1, and Safari 
1.2</b> or any later versions of these browsers.&nbsp; You are discouraged to 
use any version of Internet Explorer prior to version 7, as previous versions do 
not fully comply with the W3C CSS standards.</font></p>
<p align="left">The following software has been tested with Gravity Board X v2.0 
and <i>should</i> be fully compatible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p align="left">PHP 4.3.11</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">PHP 5.0.4 and 5.0.5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">MySQL 4.0.25-standard</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">Mozilla Firefox v1.5.0.6 or later</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#FF0000">Important:</font> Although the most 
recent version of Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 7) is much better with 
its CSS support, we still do not believe it is at the point it should be.&nbsp; 
Therefore, Gravity 
Board X was developed and tested mainly with Mozilla Firefox and designed to be 
fully compliant with CSS2 according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> 
standard.&nbsp; Very minimal 
testing was conducted using Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Because of this, the 
current 
release of GBX neither supports or recommends the use of Microsoft Internet 
Explorer (version 7 or earlier) with this software, and by all means, please do 
not use version 6 or earlier.&nbsp; If you must, use version 7 as it has the 
best CSS support to date.&nbsp; For the best compatibility, we recommend that you use Mozilla Firefox.&nbsp; Mozilla 
Firefox is available for download <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">here</a>, 
and is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Gravity Board X has been validated as

<p align="left"><u><b>Installation</b></u></p>
<p align="left">Installation of Gravity Board X is quick and simple.&nbsp; 
Follow these easy steps to install the software on your web server.</p>
<p align="left">1. Extract the .zip file to a directory on your local computer.<br>
2. Upload the files contained within the .zip file to a directory on your web 
server.&nbsp; Keep the entire directory structure in tact.&nbsp; The following files should <b>not</b> 
be uploaded: uninstall.php, readme.html<br>
3. CHMOD the directory where you uploaded the files to rwerwerew (777).&nbsp; If 
this is not done, the last part of installation will fail.<b><br>
</b>4. Navigate your browser to install.php in the directory where you uploaded 
the files to.&nbsp; Example: http://yoursite.com/gbx/install.php<br>
5. Follow the simple steps of the installer which will guide you through the 
rest of the setup process.<br>
6. After installation, remove the file install.php from 
your web server.<p align="left"><b><u><font size="5">2. Release Notes</font></u></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>What's new this release</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>
  GBX is now fully compliant if the php ini settings have <b>register_globals</b> set 
  to OFF.&nbsp; It also does not give any errors or notices if E_ALL is enabled, 
  however, E_ALL is disabled by default.</li>
  <li>
  Switched WYSIWYG editors from htmlArea to 
  <a href="http://www.fckeditor.net">FCKeditor</a> - more widely 
  accessible by different browsers and more easily customizable.&nbsp; FCKeditor 
  brings an unprecedented message editor to Gravity Board X, not seen in most 
  free message board systems.&nbsp; Creating a Word-like environment for posting 
  messages brings a whole new dimension to the message board.&nbsp; Easily 
  modify text, insert images, create hyperlinks, add smileys, and format your 
  message.&nbsp; No more BBcode, you see each change happen as you make it.&nbsp; 
  Oh yeah, you can print directly from the editor, too.</li>
  <li>
  Implemented <b>site-wide input validation system</b>.&nbsp; Open source project 
  <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/yav">yav</a> is used to validate all user input 
  on the client side using JavaScript.</li>
  <li>
  Member List feature added</li>
  <li>
  Censored words expanded and optimized (smaller size)</li>
  <li>
  User agreement feature added</li>
  <li>
  gZip compression added for all pages, when supported by the browser</li>
  <li>
  Fully restructured Administrator Control Panel</li>
  <li>
  Debugger added: The debugger is meant to primarily be used during development 
  and should have no reason to
  be used for any other purpose. It should NOT be turned on while people are 
  visiting the board.</li>
  <li>
  Added a &quot;<b>Who's Online</b>&quot; page to the board navigation</li>
  <li>
  Restructured board footer</li>
  <li>
  Passwords are now 128-bit MD5 one-way encrypted in the database and are not 
  able to be decrypted for any 
  reason whatsoever.&nbsp; Forgotten passwords will be reset.</li>
  <li>
  Email validation is required for a user to login after registration (a valid 
  email address is required to sign up)</li><li>
  txt readme upgraded to a fancy state-of-the-art next-gen HTML document (oooo 
  aaaahhh)<li>
  Restructured the entire site layout and upgraded to a<b> CSS based layout</b>, 
  instead of the prior HTML table layout.&nbsp; <b>No more tables</b>, they are a thing 
  of the past.&nbsp; The only time GBX will ever use tables again is if 
  information needs to be displayed in a tabular format.&nbsp; However, this 
  will always be avoided at all costs.&nbsp; The new look is ideal for browser 
  windows between 800 and 1280 pixels.<li>
  Information tags added to board pages.&nbsp; If a thread contains an image, 
  hyperlink, or is empty, a small image is displayed next to the thread title 
  signifying IMG, URL, or EMP, respectively.<li>
  Board descriptions added to the main page<li>
  Added &quot;Forgot My Password&quot; and &quot;Resend Validation Email&quot; features.&nbsp; 
  &quot;Forgot My Password&quot; assigns the user a new password via email (as passwords 
  are unrecoverable for security)<li>
  An uncountable number of small and large bug fixes and tweaks<li>
  <b>A new look:</b> GBX has dropped its heavily graphical header in favor of a 
  much more simple design.&nbsp; This will be easier to skin and has a &quot;Web 2.0&quot; 
  look.<li>
  <b>AJAX framework</b> has been implemented across the board.&nbsp; Use it to 
  do great things such as reorder boards with drag and drop or post and edit 
  messages on the fly.<li>
  <b>Cookies </b>are now supported to remember users when they come back</ul>
  <p>
  <br>
  FEATURES NOT YET IMPLEMENTED BUT PLANNED FOR FUTURE RELEASES:<br>
  <br>
  -Message logging. This makes it so when a user views a post, it is recorded, 
  and in the
  &quot;New&quot; table column, it shows the number of unread messages in that post or 
  board.**<br>
  <br>
  **Signifies a feature partially implemented, but disabled for this release.</p>

<h1>The GNU General Public License (GPL)</h1>
<h2>Version 2, June 1991</h2>
<p><tt>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</tt></p>
<p><tt>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</tt></p>
<tt><strong>
<p>Preamble</p>
</strong></tt>
<p><tt>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most 
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to 
your programs, too.</tt></p>
<p><tt>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can 
do these things.</tt></p>
<p><tt>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it.</tt></p>
<p><tt>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights.</tt></p>
<p><tt>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by 
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. 
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</tt></p>
<p><tt>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow.</tt></p>
<tt><strong>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
</strong></tt>
<p><tt><strong>0</strong>. This License applies to any program or other work 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, 
below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to 
say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation 
is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is 
addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the 
Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if 
its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been 
made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what theProgram 
does.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>1</strong>. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright 
notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to 
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients 
of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</tt></p>
<p><tt>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you 
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>2</strong>. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or 
any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, 
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</tt></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
  that you changed the files and the date of any change.</tt></p>
  <p><tt>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, 
  to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
  this License.</tt></p>
  <p><tt>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
  run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the 
  most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
  appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, 
  saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the 
  program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 
  this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
  normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
  required to print an announcement.)</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p><tt>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, 
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise 
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program.</tt></p>
<p><tt>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage 
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>3</strong>. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work 
based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms 
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</tt></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
  code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
  medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</tt></p>
  <p><tt>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, 
  to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
  performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
  corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
  2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</tt></p>
  <p><tt>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
  distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for 
  noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code 
  or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p><tt>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means 
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed 
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable.</tt></p>
<p><tt>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even 
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
code.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>4</strong>. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute 
the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and 
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have 
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>5</strong>. You are not required to accept this License, since 
you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by 
law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing 
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>6</strong>. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work 
based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these 
terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the 
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>7</strong>. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program 
at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or 
indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this 
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</tt></p>
<p><tt>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the 
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</tt></p>
<p><tt>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such 
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the 
free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose 
that choice.</tt></p>
<p><tt>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be 
a consequence of the rest of this License.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>8</strong>. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, 
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add 
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of 
this License.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>9</strong>. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new 
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in 
detail to address new problems or concerns.</tt></p>
<p><tt>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later 
version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>10</strong>. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the 
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the 
sharing and reuse of software generally.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>11</strong>. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER 
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE 
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE 
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</tt></p>
<p><tt><strong>12</strong>. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY 
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</tt></p>
<p><tt>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</tt></p>
<!-- START OF 'HOW TO APPLY' SECTION -->
<p><tt><strong>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</strong></tt></p>
<p><tt>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free 
software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</tt></p>
<p><tt>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line 
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</tt></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
  Copyright (C)
  <year>
  <name author of></name>
  </year>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
  under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free 
  Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any 
  later version.</tt></p>
  <p><tt>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more 
  details.</tt></p>
  <p><tt>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along 
  with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 
  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p><tt>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</tt></p>
<p><tt>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
when it starts in an interactive mode:</tt></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision 
  comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free 
  software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; 
  type `show c' for details.</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p><tt>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use 
may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</tt></p>
<p><tt>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. 
Here is a sample; alter the names:</tt></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest <br>
  in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers)<br>
  written by James Hacker.</tt></p>
  <p><tt>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p><tt>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program 
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public 
License instead of this License.</tt></p>
