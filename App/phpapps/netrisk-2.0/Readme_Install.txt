Beginning with NetRisk 2.0, the game now includes a simply installation script.  Follow the quickstep guide below to get up and running.

1.  Unzip the archive and ftp all contents to your webhost.
2.  Create a database for your game install.
3.  Visit the www.mysite.com/install/install.php to run the installer, and follow the prompts.

Thats it!  It is recommended to delete the installation directory when finished.

The Admin account will be setup with Admin rights to edit and modify games if needed.  This should be used as a last resort, as it remains untested as to how it may impace the game functionality.

If you choose to give another user admin rights, it currently has to be done manually via phpmyadmin and to edit the current users settings.  I hope to add the front end capability going forward.

Hope you enjoy the game.
