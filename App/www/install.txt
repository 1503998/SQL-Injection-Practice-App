FURTHER CONFIGURATION
=====================

URL Alias
---------

1. To use URL Alias you need to be running apache with mod_rewrite enabled.
   It is turned off in the download. I would suggest browsing some pages first to ensure .htaccess is set up correctly 
   before enabling URL Alias.   

2. Ensure you have permissions to use .htaccess, and that it is setup correctly.
   If you are installing in a sub-directory such as www/store/ , you need to reflect this path in the .htaccess.
   RewriteBase /shop/    This will set your cart root as http://www.example.com/shop/

3. If you have problems loading pages where the file has an underscore such as user_group, this is not a cart problem,
   but a server security setting. Contact your host to have this reconfigured.
